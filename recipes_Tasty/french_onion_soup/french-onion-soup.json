        "Turn up the heat to medium-high. Add \u00bd tsp salt and sugar. Stir and keep cooking until onions are brown and caramelized. (the bottom of the pan will develop some browning, it\u2019s very important!)",
        "Stir in flour one tablespoon at a time and cook for about 30 seconds.",
        "Preheat Oven To 325\u02daF (160\u02daC).",
