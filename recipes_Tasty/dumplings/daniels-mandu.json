    "description": "If you\u2019ve never heard of mandu, it\u2019s a Korean-style dumpling that can be filled with a variety of toppings and boiled, steamed, or fried. This recipe uses a mixture of tofu, pork, beef, kimchi, scallions, and seasonings. The mandu are boiled until they\u2019re tender, chewy, and bursting with flavor.
