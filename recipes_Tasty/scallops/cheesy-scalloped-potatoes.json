        "In a medium baking dish, add 2 layers of the sliced potatoes, followed by a layer of the sliced onions. Pour on half of the cheese sauce and spread with a spatula to coat all of the potatoes and onions. Add another 2 layers of potatoes and pour on the remaining cheese sauce.",
        "Cover with a lid or foil and bake for 1 hour. Then, uncover and bake for 10-15 minutes more, until the top is golden and bubbling and the potatoes are tender.",
        "Garnish with parsley and serve warm.",
        "Enjoy!"
