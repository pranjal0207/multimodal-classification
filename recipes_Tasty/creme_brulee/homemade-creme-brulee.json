    "recipeCategory": "Desserts",
    "recipeCuisine": "French",
    "recipeIngredient": [
        "4 cups heavy cream",
        "2 tsp vanilla extract",
        "6 egg yolks",
        "1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup in mixture and 1/2 cup for crust",
        "n/a"
    ],
    "recipeInstructionSteps": [
        "Heat heavy cream and vanilla extract in a sauce pan until hot, but not boiling.",
        "In a medium bowl, whisk egg yolks and half of sugar until well mixed. Pour in the hot cream gradually, mixing continually.",
        "Pour hot water into a large roasting pan. Place six ramekins into the pan (the water should come roughly halfway up the sides of the ramekins).",
        "Pour the egg mixture into the ramekins and bake at 325\u02daF (165\u02daC) for 45 - 50 minutes. The cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e should be set, but still a little jiggly in the middle.",
        "Remove the ramekins from the roasting pan, allow to cool to room temperature, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least two hours and up to three days.",
        "Remove the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e from the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before browning the sugar on top. Spread a tablespoon of sugar on top of each cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e.",
        "Using a torch, melt the sugar to for a crispy top. If you don\u2019t have a torch, you can broil the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e to melt the sugar. Keep an eye on it, to make sure you don\u2019t over cook it. Allow the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e to sit for at least five minutes before serving.",
        "Enjoy!"
