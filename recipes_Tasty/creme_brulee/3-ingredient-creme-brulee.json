    "recipeIngredient": [
        "\u00bd cup vanilla ice cream",
        "1 egg yolk",
        "1 tablespoon sugar"
    ],
    "recipeInstructionSteps": [
        "Preheat the oven to 325\u02daF (160\u02daC).",
        "Scoop the ice cream in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave the ice cream for 30 to 40 seconds or until completely melted. Allow to cool for 5 minutes.",
        "Add the egg yolk into the melted ice cream and whisk well.",
        "Pour the mixture into a ramekin. Place the ramekin in a pan. Pour hot water into the pan to come roughly halfway up the sides of the ramekin.",
        "Bake for 40-50 minutes. The cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e should be set, but still a little jiggly in the middle. Remove the ramekins from the roasting pan, allow to cool to room temperature, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, and up to 3 days.",
        "Remove the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e from the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before browning the sugar on top.",
        "Sprinkle a tablespoon of sugar on top of each cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Using a torch, melt the sugar to for a crispy top. If you don\u2019t have a torch, you can broil the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e to melt the sugar. Keep an eye on it, to make sure you don\u2019t over cook it. Allow the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e to sit for at least 5 minutes before serving.",
        "You can also make various flavor by using different ice cream flavors. If you are using flavored ice cream, use 1 egg instead of 1 yolk.",
        "Enjoy!"
