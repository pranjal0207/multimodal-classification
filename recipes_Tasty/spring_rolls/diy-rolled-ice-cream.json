    "description": "You\u2019ve probably seen rolled ice cream all over your Instagram feed, but you can actually make this Thai dessert recipe at home. And the best part: There\u2019s no fancy equipment required, just a sheet pan. Oh, and all you need is heavy cream, condensed milk, salt, and whatever toppings you like best. Looks like ice cream dreams do come true.",
    "recipeCategory": "Desserts",
    "recipeCuisine": "American",
    "recipeIngredient": [
        "1 pint heavy cream",
        "1 can sweetened condensed milk",
        "Pinch of salt",
        "Topping of choice"
    ],
    "recipeInstructionSteps": [
        "Whisk the heavy cream, condensed milk, and salt in a bowl.",
        "Pour the mixture over a half sheet pan, or multiple quarter sheet pans. Make sure the ice cream base just barely covers the bottom. It should be \u00bc-inch (6 mm) thick or less.",
        "Sprinkle any chopped-up toppings you would like. With a whisk, mix the toppings into the ice cream base to ensure they\u2019re evenly distributed.",
        "Freeze for at least 4 hours. Make sure to also put your scrapers and ice cream bowls in the freezer so the ice cream doesn\u2019t melt while rolling.",
        "After the ice cream is frozen solid, remove from the freezer and quickly place the metal spatula/paint scraper at an 45\u00b0 angle against the edge of the pan, pushing carefully forward. If the ice cream needs a little help forming, use a butter knife to push the sheet of cream into the roll.",
        "Place the rolled ice cream in a chilled bowl and top with any toppings you desire.",
        "Enjoy!"
