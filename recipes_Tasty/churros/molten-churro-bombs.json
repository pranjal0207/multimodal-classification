    "recipeIngredient": [
        "1 cup water",
        "4 tablespoons (\u00bd stick) unsalted butter",
        "\u00bd cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar, divided",
        "\u00bd teaspoon salt",
        "1 cup all-purpose flour",
        "3 large eggs",
        "1 teaspoon vanilla extract",

    "recipeInstructionSteps": [
        "In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the water, butter, 2 tablespoons sugar, and the salt, and bring to a boil.",
        "As soon as the mixture begins to boil, reduce the heat to medium-low and add the flour. Using a wooden spoon, stir until the dough comes together to form a ball, about 1 minute.",
        "Remove the pan from the heat and let cool for 5 minutes before proceeding to avoid accidentally cooking the eggs.",
        "Mix in the eggs, 1 at a time, fully incorporating each egg before adding the next. Then add the vanilla.",
        "Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.",
        "Transfer the dough to a piping bag fitted with a closed star tip.",
        "Pipe 18 1\u00bd-inch (3 cm) spiral rounds onto the baking sheet. Top each with a milk chocolate truffle. Pipe the dough in a spiral to cover the truffles, being careful to completely seal the chocolate. Immediately transfer the tray to the freezer and freeze for 1 hour, until solid.",
        "Heat the oil in a deep pot until it reaches 350\u02daF (180\u02daC).",
        "Fry in batches of 4 until nicely browned, about 3 minutes, turning so they fry evenly. Drain on a cooling rack, or paper towel-lined plate and dab off any excess oil.",
        "Combine the remaining \u00bd cup sugar (100 G) and the cinnamon in a small bowl. Roll the warm churro bombs in the mixture to coat.",
        "Enjoy!"
