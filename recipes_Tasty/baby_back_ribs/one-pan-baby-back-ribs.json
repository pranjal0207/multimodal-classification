    "description": "You don\u2019t need a barbecue to make flavorful baby back ribs \u2014 in fact, all you really need is one sheet tray. After slowly roasting the ribs on it, load it up with corn and asparagus in the final ten minutes of cooking and dinner is done. The ribs will be falling off the bone, and the veggies will be perfectly tender yet crisp. The best part? You\u2019ll only have to wash one dish.",
