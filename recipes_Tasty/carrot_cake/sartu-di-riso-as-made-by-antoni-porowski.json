        "Add the canned tomatoes and break them apart with tongs or the back of a wooden spoon.",
        "Add the Parmesan rind and basil, burying them into the sauce.",
        "Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes until the sauce has thickened and the flavors have developed. Remove and discard the Parmesan rind, bay leaves, and basil. Set the sauce aside to cool.",

        "Preheat the oven to 400\u02daF (200\u02daC)",

        "Add the breadcrumbs and tilt the pan around to coat. Once well-coated, tap out excess crumbs into a bowl and reserve.",
