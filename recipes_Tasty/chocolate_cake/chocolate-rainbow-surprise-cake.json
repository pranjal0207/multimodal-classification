        "In a greased bundt pan, spoon about \u2153 of the prepared Chocolate Cake Mix onto the bottom. Using a tablespoon, carefully spoon a thin ring of Red Cake Batter on top of the chocolate layer - being careful to keep it centered and ensure it does not spread to the edge of the pan.",
        "Repeat with Yellow, Green, and Blue Batter, carefully spooning each on top of the previous. Finish by carefully covering the colored layers with an additional \u2153 of the Chocolate Cake Mix (leaving about \u2153 extra so as not to overfill the pan).",
