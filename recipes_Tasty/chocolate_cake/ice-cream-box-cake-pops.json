    "recipeCategory": "Desserts",
    "recipeCuisine": "American",
    "recipeIngredient": [
        "1 15-ounce box of yellow cake mix, prepared according to package instructions, cooled",
        "\u00bd cup vanilla frosting",
        "1 cup vanilla ice cream, softened",
        "1 cup crushed chocolate cookies",
        "1 cup chocolate ice cream, softened",
        "2 cups plus 2 tablespoons melted white chocolate, divided",
        "Whipped cream, for decorating (optional)",
        "Sprinkles, for decorating (optional)",
        "24 ice pop sticks",
        "Foam board (optional)"
    ],
    "recipeInstructionSteps": [
        "In a large bowl, crumble the cake into fine uniform crumbs. Add the vanilla frosting and mix thoroughly.",
        "Press 1 tablespoon of the cake mixture into each of the divots of an ice cube tray.",
        "Spread 1 tablespoon of vanilla ice cream over the cake. Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon of crushed cookies.",
        "Spread 1 tablespoon of chocolate ice cream on top (the ice cream might melt and mix slightly).",
        "Freeze for 30 minutes.",
        "Dip the ice pop sticks into 2 tablespoons of melted white chocolate and press them into the centers of the ice cream cake pops. Freeze for at least 8 hours, until solid.",
        "To make the cake pop holder, cut 3 2-foot by 5-inch (\u00bd meter by 13 cm) strips of foam board. Place tape in between each layer, one on top of the other, so you have 3 layers of foam board. Carefully create 24  \u00bd-inch (1 cm) slits 2 inches (2 cm) apart with a precision knife. Cut deep enough so you puncture the second layer of foam board. Each cake pop should easily push into the board and stand upright.",
        "Use a butter knife or offset spatula to loosen the ice cream cake pops from the ice cube tray.",
        "Add the remaining melted white chocolate to a tall drinking glass. Working 1 at a time, pull each cake pop from the ice cube mold and dip into the melted white chocolate. Place the cake pops in the cake pop holder or on a plate and keep in the freezer until ready to serve.",
        "Decorate the cake pops with whipped cream and sprinkles, if desired.",
        "Serve immediately.",
        "Enjoy!"
