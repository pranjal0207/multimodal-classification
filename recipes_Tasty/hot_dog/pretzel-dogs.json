        "Dust the cutting board with flour, and cut the pizza dough into 4 equal pieces.",
        "Roll each piece of dough out until it\u2019s a 12-inch (30 cm) rope. It\u2019s okay if the dough naturally shrinks.",
        "Take the rolled out dough and wrap it around a hot dog in a spiraling motion, leaving room on the ends.",
        "In a pot, combine the baking soda with the water and bring it to a boil.",

        "Top the pretzels with your toppings of choice.",
        "For sea salt, sprinkle the salt on top. For jalape\u00f1o cheddar, top the pretzel with cheddar cheese, then follow with jalape\u00f1os. For garlic butter, combine the butter, garlic, and parsley, and brush on top. For pizza, top with mozzarella and follow with pepperoni.",
        "Bake in the oven for 12-15 minutes, or until it reaches a deep golden brown.",
        "Enjoy!"
