    "recipeIngredient": [
        "n/a",
        "\u00bc cup butter, melted",
        "2 garlic cloves, minced",
        "2 tablespoons parsley, finely chopped",
        "8 slices cheddar cheese",
        "1 15-ounce can chili, with or without beans",

    ],
    "recipeInstructionSteps": [
        "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C).",
        "Leaving them attached, place the 8 hot dog buns in a 9 x 13-inch (22 x 33-cm) baking dish. Cut a rectangle in each hot dog bun, making sure to stay 1 centimeter from the edges. Push down on the bread cut-out to compact it tightly into the bottom of each bun, making sure to press down on the bottom edges as well. This will help create a larger space for the fillings and reduce mess.",
        "Mix the butter, garlic, and parsley in a small bowl, then brush the buns and their hollowed insides with the garlic butter. Bake for 5 minutes to toast the buns as well as help the sides of the buns firm up so they don\u2019t collapse under the weight of the fillings.",
        "Place a slice of cheddar cheese inside each bun, then spoon a bit of chili inside each one. Slide a hot dog snugly on top of the chili in each bun, then top with more chili.",
        "Bake for 20-25 minutes, until the cheese is golden brown and the chili has started to brown. Top with fresh parsley, then slice the hot dog boats along their connected seams to serve.",
        "Enjoy!"
