    "recipeIngredient": [
        "50 grams vegan margarine",
        "120 millilitres soy milk",
        "2 tablespoons sunflower oil, plus 1 litre extra for frying",
        "250 grams plain flour",
        "100 grams caster sugar",
        "1 teaspoon baking powder",
        "1/2 teaspoon salt"

    "recipeInstructionSteps": [
        "Gently melt the butter over a low-medium heat. Add milk and 2 tablespoons of sunflower oil and mix together.",
        "Once combined, take off the heat and set aside.",
        "In a separate bowl, combine the flour, half of the sugar, baking powder and salt with a fork.",
        "Make a well in the center and pour in the butter mixture. Combine gradually until a thick dough forms.",
        "Using your hands, roll dough into little flat balls and with your thumb, press a hole in the center of each doughnut. (You may need to flour your hands for this part to avoid getting sticky!)",
        "Heat up oil in a pan. To know when it&#x27;s hot enough, fry a little bit of bread in the oil. If it goes brown and floats to the top, in 45-50 seconds the oil will be ready!",
        "Gently lay the doughnuts into the oil using a spatula. Fry for about 3-5 minutes on each side, until golden brown.",
        "Transfer the doughnuts onto some tissue paper to soak up any excess oil.",
        "Roll the doughnut into a bowl of the remaining half of sugar.",
        "Enjoy!"
