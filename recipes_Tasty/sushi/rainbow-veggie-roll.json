    "recipeIngredient": [
        "2 cups sushi rice, cooked",
        "\u00bc cup seasoned rice vinegar",
        "4 half sheets sushi grade nori",
        "1 avocado, thinly sliced",
        "1 small cucumber, cut into matchsticks",
        "1 cup assorted colored bell peppers, cut into matchsticks",

    "recipeInstructionSteps": [
        "Season the sushi rice with the rice vinegar, fanning and stirring until room temperature.",
        "On the rolling mat place one sheet of nori with the rough side facing upwards.",
        "Wet your hands and grab a handful of rice and place it on your nori. Sprinkle with seasame seeds (optional). Spread the rice evenly throughout the nori without smushing the rice down. Flip so the nori is facing upwards.",
        "Arrange, in a horizontal row 1 inch (2 cm) from the bottom, bell peppers, cucumbers, and avocado slices.",
        "Grabbing both nori and the mat, roll the mat over the filling so the extra space at the bottom touches the other side, squeezing down to make a nice tight roll. Squeeze down along the way to keep the roll from holding its shape.",
        "Transfer the roll onto a cutting board. Rub a knife on a damp paper towel before slicing the roll into six equal portions.",
        "Enjoy!"
