        "In a large bowl, mix 2 mashed bananas, 1 cup of the melted peanut butter, and the sweetened condensed milk; if needed, add extra milk to loosen the mixture. Pour the mixture over the cake and let it settle into the holes for about 10 minutes. Some of the mixture will stay on top, which is okay.",
