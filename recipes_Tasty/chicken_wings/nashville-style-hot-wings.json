        "4 Cups buttermilk",
        "1/2 Cup lard",
        "1 Cup flour",
        "* 1/2 cup cayenne",

    "recipeInstructionSteps": [
        "Combine all master spice mix ingredients and separate into three equal portions.",
        "In a large bowl combine chicken wings, \u2153 master spice mix, the buttermilk. Cover and chill for as long as possible (4 hours to overnight).",
        "Rinse the brined wing pieces and pat dry.",
        "Mix the flour with another \u2153 of the master spice mix.",
        "Dredge the chicken wing pieces in the flour/spice mixture. Shake off any excess. Set aside.",
        "Heat your oil to 325\u02daF (170\u02daC).",
        "Fry the wings for 8-10 minutes, until the internal temperature reaches 165\u02daF (74\u02daC). The wings will splatter so its a good idea to have a lid nearby!",

        "Place the lard in a saucepan and sprinkle over the last \u2153 of your master spice mix. Once the lard is melted and warm, stir the mixture, and take it off the heat. Immediately baste your fried wings with the lard/spice mix and serve right away!",
        "Enjoy!"
