        "Preheat the oven to 350\u02daF (180\u02daC).",
        "Peel and core the apples. Soak the peeled apples in a large bowl filled with water and lemon juice so they won\u2019t brown.  Working one at a time, thinly slice the apples.",
        "Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the apple slices and sprinkle with the sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Stir continuously and cook until the apples are soft, about 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat.",
        "Make the taco shells: Using a cookie cutter or the lid of a mason jar, cut out 14 small circles from the tortillas.",
        "Brush the small tortilla rounds with melted butter and coat with cinnamon sugar. Shape the cut-out tortillas to look like taco shells and place between the cups of an upside-down muffin tin to hold their shapes.",
        "Bake for 10 minutes, or until golden brown. Let the taco shells cool until easy to handle.",
        "Spoon the apple pie filling into the taco shells. Top with small scoops of vanilla ice cream and drizzle with caramel sauce.",
        "Enjoy!"
