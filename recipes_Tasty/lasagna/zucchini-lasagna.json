    "description": "When it comes to comfort food, there are few meals as satisfying as warm, cheesy lasagna. This recipe is a lighter take on classic lasagna. It\u2019s made with thinly sliced zucchini in place of noodles, and it calls for ground turkey for the meat sauce, but it still contains everything you love about the classic dish.",
