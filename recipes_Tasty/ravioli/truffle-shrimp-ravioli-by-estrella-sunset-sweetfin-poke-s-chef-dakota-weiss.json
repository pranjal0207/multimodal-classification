        "Make the pasta by adding flour and a pinch of salt to the bowl of a food processor, pulse a few times.",
        "Add the egg yolks, milk, and olive oil.",
        "Run the food processor, adding additional milk or flour if the mixture is too wet or dry. Once it to starts to clump together and becomes a dough, let it get \u201cworked\u201d in the food processor for about 10 turns.",
        "Take your pasta to a floured table surface and knead it with your hands until you start to get a shiny, smooth surface. Wrap in plastic and set it aside to rest, about 30 minutes.",
        "Add all of the truffle shrimp mousse ingredients to a cleaned food processor and run until very smooth.",

        "Run the dough strip through your pasta machine from the machine\u2019s widest setting a few times until smooth.",
        "Start rolling the dough through the settings, towards the most narrow, skipping no settings in between, rolling the dough through each setting twice.",
