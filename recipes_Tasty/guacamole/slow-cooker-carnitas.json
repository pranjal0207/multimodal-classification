    "description": "Have you ever gone out for Mexican food, eaten carnitas, and thought \u201cgosh, I wish I could make this myself\u201d? Well, you can with the help of your slow cooker. Just add pork butt or shoulder to a slow cooker with citrus juice, garlic, onion, and some spices, then let it cook for about eight hours until it's tender and easy to shred with a fork. Then, you can enjoy your home-cooked carnitas in tacos, burritos, or on top of your favourite grains.",
