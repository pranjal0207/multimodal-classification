    "description": "Forget dry pork chops because these pan-fried cutlets are coated in golden panko bread crumbs and stuffed with a creamy garlic and herb cheese filling to keep them juicy.  They\u2019re tender, bursting with flavor, and come together in less than 30 minutes.  If you\u2019ve only ever had dry, sad pork chops before and want to try something different, this is the recipe for you.",

        "Season all sides of the pork chops with salt and pepper.",
        "Carefully cut a pocket through the side of the pork chop in order to create a cavity. Stuff the cavity with a generous spoonful of the cream cheese mixture and press around the edges of the pork to seal it in. Repeat with the remaining pork chops.",
