        "Preheat gas grill on high heat.",
        "Using a sharp knife, slice the avocados in half by cutting in a straight line around the pit.",
        "Place the avocado half containing the pit in your hand and face it away from you. Gently stick the tip of the knife into the side of the pit and carefully pry it out of the avocado.  For a ripe avocado, the pit will pop out with little effort. You can hold a kitchen towel in your hand and place the avocado in the towel for added protection from the edge of your knife.",
