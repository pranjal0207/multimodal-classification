        "Generously season all sides of the steak with salt and pepper.",
        "Transfer to a wire rack on top of a baking sheet, then bake for about 45 minutes to an hour until the internal temperature reads about 125\u00b0F (51\u00b0 C) for medium-rare. Adjust the bake time based on if you like your steak more rare or more well-done.",
        "Heat the canola oil in a pan over high heat until smoking.",
        "Sear the steak for 30 seconds on the first side, then flip.",
        "Add the butter, garlic, rosemary, and thyme, and swirl around the pan.",

        "Enjoy!"
