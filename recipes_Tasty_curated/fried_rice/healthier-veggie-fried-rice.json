        "Add the brown rice, vegetable broth, and diced carrots to your Instant Pot. Stir until combined.",
        "Close the lid until you hear the beep. Tip: Closing the lid can be tricky. Have the pressure knob at 11 o\u2019clock and turn right.",
        "Turn pressure knob to \u201cSealing\u201d. Select Manual and reduce the time to 24 minutes. It will say \u201cOn\u201d in a few seconds. Note: the Instant Pot will need to warm up for 5-10 minutes. Steam will be released and a few minutes later, the time will start counting down.",
        "Once the time goes off, carefully turn the pressure knob to \u201cVenting\u201d. Let all of the stream release before opening the lid.",
        "Stir the rice, then transfer from the pot into a medium sized bowl and set aside.",
        "Select \u201cSaute\u201d on the Instant Pot.  Once it says \u201cHot\u201d, add the oil.",
        "When the oil is shimmering, add the onion. Cook for around 1 minute until slightly opaque.",
        "Add the minced garlic, frozen peas, salt, and pepper. Mix until incorporated.",
        "Add rice mixture and stir until everything is combined.",
        "Make a well in the middle of the rice for the eggs. Pour the beaten eggs into the well, stirring only the eggs until they are cooked.",
        "Mix everything together. Top with scallions.",
        "Enjoy!"
