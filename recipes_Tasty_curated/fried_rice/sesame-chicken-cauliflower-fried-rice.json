        "Remove all leaves and cut the cauliflower into small florets.",

        "Add the peas, carrots, soy sauce, and black pepper.",

        "Spread the rice towards the edge of the pan, creating a well in the center.",
        "Pour the beaten eggs into the well, stirring only the eggs until they are cooked.",
        "Fold the eggs into the rice, then mix in the sesame seeds.",
        "Enjoy!"
