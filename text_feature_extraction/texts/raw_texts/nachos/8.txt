2 tablespoons vegetable oil 2 tablespoons flour 2 tablespoons tomato paste 1¾ cup chicken stock 1 tablespoon chili powder ½ teaspoon oregano 1 teaspoon cumin 1 teaspoon garlic powder Salt and pepper, to taste n/a 2 cups shredded chicken Tortilla chips 2 cups Mexican cheese blend ½ cup sour cream 1 diced tomato Cilantro leaves (optional) Queso fresco (optional)
Heat a small saucepan over medium heat and add the oil and flour. Whisk together and cook gently until it resembles wet sand, about 1 minute. Add the tomato paste and whisk. Add chicken stock, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, oregano, salt and pepper. Stir. Bring up to a simmer and cook about 5 minutes until sauce thickens. Remove from heat and set aside. Reserve ½ cup (120 ml). Toss the shredded chicken with about ½ cup (120 ml) of the reserved sauce. Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Place a layer of tortilla chips in a skillet or bake dish. Add a layer of cheese and half the chicken mixture. Drizzle some enchilada sauce over the top. Add a second layer of tortilla chips followed by another layer of cheese and the remaining chicken. Drizzle with sauce. Bake for 8-10 minutes until cheese is melted. Top with sour cream, diced tomato, cilantro, and crumbled queso fresco. Serve immediately. Enjoy!
