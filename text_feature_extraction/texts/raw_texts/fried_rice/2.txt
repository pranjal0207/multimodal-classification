Fusion
1 cauliflower head Â¾ pound flank steak, sliced into small strips 2 cups broccoli florets 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon black pepper 2 tablespoons soy sauce 2 tablespoons brown sugar
Remove all leaves and cut the cauliflower into small florets. Place the florets in a food processor and blend until they are a rice-like texture. Be careful not to over process or it may turn mushy. Set aside, and drain excess moisture with a towel, if desired. In a large saucepan over medium-high heat, cook the steak until no pink is showing. Add the broccoli, salt, pepper, soy sauce, and brown sugar. Cook for 4-5 minutes until most of the liquid has reduced. Add the cauliflower rice, then cook for about 3-4 more minutes. Enjoy!
