3 cups frozen strawberries 2 frozen bananas, sliced Â½ cup Greek yogurt
Combine ingredients into a food processor or high-speed blender, process until consistently pink and completely smooth.  Pour into a pan and smooth into an even layer. Freeze for 2 hours, or until frozen but still a little soft for scooping. (If freezing overnight, cover with a lid or plastic wrap, but let it sit out at room temperature for about 5-10 minutes before scooping). Scoop into a bowl and top with your favorite toppings. Enjoy!
