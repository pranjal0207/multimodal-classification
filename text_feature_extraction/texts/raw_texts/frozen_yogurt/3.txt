Combine ingredients into a food processor or high-speed blender. Pour into a pan and smooth into an even layer. Freeze for 2 hours, or until frozen but still a little soft for scooping. (If freezing overnight, cover with a lid or plastic wrap, but let it sit out at room temperature for about 5-10 minutes before scooping). Scoop into a bowl and top with your favorite toppings.
