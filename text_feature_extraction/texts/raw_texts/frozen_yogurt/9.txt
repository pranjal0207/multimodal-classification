Cut the bananas in half horizontally. Insert popsicle sticks in the middle of the banana halves. Transfer bananas to a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, and freeze until solid. In a tall glass or mixing cup, add Greek yogurt and almond milk, and mix together. If the texture is too thick, add more almond milk until the coating is silky. Place chocolate chips onto a plate. Dip the bananas into the yogurt coating, then roll or sprinkle on toppings. Place bananas in freezer until the coating has hardened. Enjoy!
