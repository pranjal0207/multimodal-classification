American
3 frozen bananas, sliced 1 cup Greek yogurt 1 cup peanut butter Â½ cup mini dark chocolate chips
Combine all ingredients except the chocolate chips into a food processor or high-speed blender, process until consistent color and completely smooth. Pour into a pan. Mix into dark chocolate chips and smooth into an even layer. Freeze 2 hours, or until frozen but still a little soft for scooping. (If freezing overnight, cover with a lid or plastic wrap, but let it sit out at room temperature for about 5-10 minutes before scooping). Scoop into a bowl and top with your favorite toppings. Enjoy!
