American
12 eggs, hard-boiled ½ cup mayonnaise 1 tablespoon mustard 1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning ½ cup celery, finely chopped n/a 1 teaspoon hot sauce (or more for desired spice) Smoked paprika, for garnish Chopped green onion, for garnish
Place the eggs in a pot and fill with cold water until the eggs are just covered. Bring the pot to a boil, then cover, remove from heat, and let sit for about 12 minutes. Transfer the eggs to a bowl of ice water for about 3 minutes, then peel them and cut them in half. Transfer the egg yolks to a bowl, and set the cooked egg whites aside. Mix the mayonnaise, mustard, Cajun seasoning, celery, bell pepper, and hot sauce with the yolks and transfer to a piping bag. (Alternatively, use a zip-top bag with a corner cut off.) Pipe the mixture into the eggs, garnish with the smoked paprika and green onion, and serve chilled. Enjoy!
