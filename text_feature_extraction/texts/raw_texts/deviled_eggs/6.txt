Place the eggs in a pot and fill with cold water until the eggs are just covered. Bring the pot to a boil, then cover, remove from heat, and let sit for about 12 minutes. Transfer the eggs to a bowl of ice water for about 3 minutes, then peel them and cut them in half. Transfer the egg yolks to a bowl, and set the cooked egg whites aside. Mix the avocado, cilantro, jalapeño, red onion, tomato, garlic, cumin, lime juice, and salt with the yolks and transfer to a piping bag. (Alternatively, use a zip-top bag with a corner cut off.) Pipe the mixture into the eggs, garnish with cilantro and crushed tortilla chips, and serve chilled. Enjoy!
