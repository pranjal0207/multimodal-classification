Cut each egg in half and remove the yolk. Place the yolks in a medium bowl, and refrigerate the whites while you prepare the filling. In a large bowl bowl, mix together the avocado, Greek yogurt, mustard, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Add the egg yolks and mash with a fork to incorporate. For a smoother filling, add the ingredients to a food processor and pulse to combine. Transfer the filing to a piping bag fitted with a round tip or a zip-top bag with a corner snipped off. Pipe the filling into the egg whites. Sprinkle with paprika. Enjoy!
