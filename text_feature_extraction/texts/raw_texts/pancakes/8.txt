Healthy Banana Pancakes Recipe by Tasty
Breakfast
Here's what you need: ripe banana, egg, vanilla extract, quick-cook oats, cinnamon
American
2 ripe bananas 2 eggs 1 teaspoon vanilla extract ½ cup quick oats 1 teaspoon cinnamon
Mash bananas in a large bowl until smooth. Mix in eggs and vanilla until well combined, then mix in oats and cinnamon. Heat a skillet to medium and add in a scoop* of the pancake batter. Smooth out to form an even layer. Cook for about 2-3 minutes until you start to see bubbles releasing from the top of the batter. Flip and cook until the other side is golden brown, about 1-2 minutes. Garnish your pancakes with your favorite toppings! We used banana slices, chopped walnuts &amp; maple syrup. Enjoy! *Note: Use ½ cup for scooping the batter to yield 4 thicker pancakes; Use ⅓ cup to yield 6 smaller pancakes.
