American
2 bananas 2 eggs ½ cup quick oats 2 tablespoons dark cocoa powder ¼ cup dark chocolate chips ¼ teaspoon salt
Mash bananas in a large bowl until smooth. Mix in eggs until well combined, then mix in remaining ingredients. Heat a skillet to medium and add in a scoop of the pancake batter. Smooth out to form an even layer. Cook for about 2-3 minutes until you start to see bubbles releasing from the top of the batter. Flip and cook until the other side is golden brown, about 1-2 minutes. Garnish your pancakes with your favorite toppings! We used fresh strawberries and maple syrup. Enjoy!
