Nonstick cooking spray, optional 1 large white or yellow onion 1 cup whole wheat bread crumbs or panko bread crumbs ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese 2 teaspoons garlic powder 1 teaspoon paprika 1 teaspoon dried oregano 1 teaspoon dried basil 1 teaspoon salt ½ teaspoon pepper 3 large eggs, beaten 1 cup all-purpose flour Dipping sauce of choice, optional
Preheat the oven to 425˚F (220˚C). Grease a baking sheet with nonstick spray or line with parchment paper. Cut the onion crosswise into ½-inch (1 cm) slices and gently push apart each layer to get individual rings. Set aside. In a large bowl, combine the bread crumbs, Parmesan, garlic powder, paprika, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Add the eggs to a separate large bowl. Add the flour to a third large bowl. Dredge the onion rings in the flour, then the eggs, then finally in the bread crumb mixture, making sure to coat all sides. Arrange the onion rings on the baking sheet. Bake for 10-15 minutes, flipping halfway through, until golden brown on both sides. Serve with your favorite dipping sauce. Enjoy!
