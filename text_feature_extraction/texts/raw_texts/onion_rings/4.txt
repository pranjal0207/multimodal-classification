American
1 (14 ounce) can fresh cut green beans 1  (10 ½ ounce) can cream of mushroom soup ½ cup French fried onions 1 package of frozen onion rings
In a medium bowl, mix together green beans, soup, and French fried onions. Spray down a medium-sized baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray and arrange onion rings so that they are all 1.5-2 inches (4-5 cm) apart. Using a spoon or spatula, scoop soup/green bean mixture into the middle of each onion ring, making sure to fill each ring evenly before placing another onion ring on top and repeating the process. (NOTE: Make sure to use the largest onion rings first as the base to your stacks, using the smaller rings later towards the top.) Bake stacks at 350˚F (180˚C) for 18-22 minutes or until onion rings are crisp and golden and green bean mixture is bubbling on top. Let cool for at least 5 minute before transferring to a plate to serve. Enjoy!
