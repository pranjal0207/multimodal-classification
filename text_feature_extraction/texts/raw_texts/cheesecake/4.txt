Preheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C). Prepare the brownie batter and pour into greased springform pan. Bake until set, about 20-25 minutes. Meanwhile, beat the cream cheese and sugar until incorporated. Add beaten eggs and vanilla, and beat again until smooth. Remove brownies and lower oven temperature to 325˚F (165˚C). Pour cheesecake batter over brownie bottom, and bake for 50 minutes until set and slightly jiggly. Remove cheesecake and refrigerate for 4 hours, or overnight. Heat or microwave whipping cream to just before boiling and pour over chocolate chips. Stir continuously until the chocolate is melted and smooth. Allow the ganache to sit for 10-15 minutes. Transfer cheesecake to a baking pan with a wire rack. In a circular motion starting from the inside out, pour the ganache glaze over the cheesecake making sure to cover all sides. Allow ganache to cool and set for 30 minutes. Enjoy!
