Spread a generous amount of caramel on each slice. Place a few pieces of banana at the bottom and roll it up tight. Whisk the eggs together in a small bowl. Dip the roll-up into the egg and then biscuit crumbs. Fry over a medium heat in butter for 2-3 minutes each side. Serve with a dollop of whipped cream and some finely grated chocolate. Enjoy!
