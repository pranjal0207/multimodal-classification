Easy Ravioli “Lasagna” Recipe by Tasty
Dinner
Here's what you need: ravioli, bolognese sauce, shredded cheddar cheese
Fusion
1:1 ratio of Ravioli to Bolognese sauce, (we used about 600g of each, but it will depend on the size of your baking tray and the amount of portions you need) n/a Cheddar Cheese
NOTE: We used about 600g of each, Ravioli (1 ⅓lb) and Bolognese sauce (2 ¼cup). Depending on your pan size this will vary. Cover the base of a deep dish baking tray with a layer of ravioli. Cover this with a thin layer of bolognese sauce, use the back of a spoon to spread it around evenly. Sprinkle a thin layer of grated cheddar over the bolognese sauce. Put down another layer of ravioli, followed by another layer of bolognese sauce. Cover all of this with a generous topping of more grated cheese. Cover the tray with tin foil and bake in the center of a pre-heated oven for 35 mins. 200°C (400°F) Gas Mark 6. Remove the tin foil and bake for a further 8-10 minutes, or until the cheese on top has melted and browned a bit. Enjoy!
