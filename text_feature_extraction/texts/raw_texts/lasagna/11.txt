Zucchini Lasagna Recipe by Tasty
Dinner
When it comes to comfort food, there are few meals as satisfying as warm, cheesy lasagna. This recipe is a lighter take on classic lasagna. It’s made with thinly sliced zucchini in place of noodles, and it calls for ground turkey for the meat sauce, but it still contains everything you love about the classic dish.

2 zucchinis 1 cup grated parmesan 2 tablespoons olive oil ½ large white onion 2 cloves garlic 1 pound ground turkey 28 ounces crushed tomatoes 2 teaspoons dried basil 2 teaspoons dried parsley 2 teaspoons dried oregano ½ teaspoon salt ½ teaspoon pepper 1 tablespoon tomato paste 1 bay leaf 16 ounces ricotta cheese 1 egg 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, minced ¼ cup grated parmesan ¼ teaspoon salt ½ teaspoon pepper
Cut the ends off of the zucchini, and cut in half, lengthwise. Using a vegetable peeler, peel long strips of zucchini (these will be your “noodles”) and set on a baking sheet lined with paper towels. Dab zucchini strips with a paper towel to absorb the excess moisture. In a large pot, add olive oil, onions, and garlic. Cook until translucent, about 4-5 minutes. Add ground turkey, and cook for another 4-5 minutes, or until the turkey has browned slightly. Pour in crushed tomatoes, basil, parsley, oregano, salt, pepper, tomato paste, and a bay leaf. Cover and let simmer for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 375˚F (190˚C). In a bowl, combine ricotta cheese, egg, parsley, parmesan, salt, and pepper. Mix until well combined. Using a baking dish, layer turkey sauce, zucchini strips, ricotta mixture, and parmesan. Repeat until there are 3 layers total, ending with the turkey sauce and topping that with parmesan cheese. Bake for 50 minutes (times and temperatures may vary depending on the oven). Let rest for at least 20 minutes. Enjoy!
