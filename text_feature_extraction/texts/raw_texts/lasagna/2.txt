Italian
3 chicken breasts n/a n/a 1 cup flour 5 eggs 2 cups Italian bread crumbs Vegetable oil 15 ounces ricotta 24 ounces marinara sauce 8 lasagna noodles 2 cups mozzarella 2 cups parmesan Basil
Cut chicken breasts in half (pound thin if necessary) and season with salt and pepper. Add the flour, 4 eggs, and bread crumbs to 3 separate shallow dishes. Beat the eggs. Coat the chicken in the flour, then the eggs, and finally in the bread crumbs. Heat the vegetable oil in a cast iron skillet over medium heat. Fry the chicken on both sides until golden brown, about 4 minutes  on each side. Let drain on paper towels. In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese and the remaining egg. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Spread about ⅓ of the marinara sauce over the bottom of a casserole dish. Top with 4 lasagna noodles, ½ of the ricotta mixture, and 3 chicken cutlets. Sprinkle with ½ cup of mozzarella and ½ cup of Parmesan cheese. Repeat to make another layer, then finish with the remaining sauce and mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. Cover with foil and bake for 45-60 minutes, uncovering the lasagna for the last 10 minutes of baking. Serve with a sprinkle of fresh basil. Enjoy!
