Here's what you need: round sourdough loaf, camembert cheese, butter, fresh parsley, garlic, bacon
Fusion
Round sourdough loaf 250 grams camembert cheese 75 grams butter, melted 10 grams fresh parsley, chopped 2 cloves of garlic, crushed 150 grams cooked bacon, chopped
Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Slice the camembert into thick matchsticks. Make deep, thick slits into the bread without cutting all the way through, about 90% down is good. Rotate the bread 90° and make more cuts, 90% through again, creating little sticks of bread that are all held together by the crust at the bottom. Combine the butter, parsley and garlic. Stuff camembert in between the bread sticks. Drop the cooked bacon bits over the bread, pushing some of them down into the cracks. Drizzle butter evenly over the bread. Bake for 18-20 minutes until the camembert is melted and the top of the bread is crusty. Enjoy!
