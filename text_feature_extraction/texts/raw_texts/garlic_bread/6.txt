Appetizers
Here's what you need: pizza dough, butter, garlic, fresh parsley, salt, shredded mozzarella cheese, shredded cheddar cheese, deli ham

24 ounces pizza dough 1 cup butter, melted 6 garlic cloves, minced ¼ cup fresh parsley, chopped 1 teaspoon salt 3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese 3 cups shredded cheddar cheese 10 deli ham slices, halved
Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Roll out pizza dough into an 18x10-inch (45x25-cm) rectangle. In a bowl, combine butter, garlic, parsley, and salt. Use a spatula to spread an even layer of the mixture over the dough. Sprinkle a generous handful of mozzarella and cheddar cheese in a square checkerboard pattern across the dough, making 20 squares. Place a piece of ham over each section of cheese. Cut the dough into 20 evenly sized squares and stack four on top of each other, alternating cheeses as you go. There will be five stacks of four. Place stacks in an 8½x4½-inch (21x11-cm) bread pan. Bake for 35 minutes. Enjoy!
