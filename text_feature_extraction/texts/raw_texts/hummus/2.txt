Pour the rinsed chickpeas onto half the area of a kitchen towel. Fold the other half of the towel on top of the beans, and rub them so that the skins start to come off. Place all of the peeled beans in the bowl of a food processor, along with the salt, cumin, garlic, and beets. Turn the processor on to break up the mixture. With the food processor running, pour in the lemon juice and olive oil, and let the processor run until the mixture is smooth. Serve with your choice of dipping chips or veggies. Enjoy!
