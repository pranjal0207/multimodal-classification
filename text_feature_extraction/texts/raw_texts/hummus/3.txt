1 15-ounce can garbanzo beans, drained and rinsed ½ teaspoon salt ½ teaspoon ground cumin 1 small garlic clove, minced 1 tablespoon lemon juice 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil ¼ teaspoon sesame oil ¼ cup water
Pour the rinsed chickpeas onto half the area of a kitchen towel. Fold the other half of the towel on top of the beans, and rub them so that the skins start to come off. Place all of the peeled beans in the bowl of a food processor, along with the salt, cumin, and garlic. Turn the processor on to break up the mixture. With the food processor running, pour in the lemon juice, olive oil, sesame oil, and water, and let the processor run until the mixture is smooth. Serve with your choice of dipping chips or veggies. Enjoy!
