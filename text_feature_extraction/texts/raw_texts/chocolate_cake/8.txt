American
1 box chocolate cake mix 2 cups heavy cream 16 ounces dark chocolate Cocoa powder, to serve
Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C). In a large bowl, prepare the cake mix according to the package instructions. Pour the batter into a well-greased bundt pan. Bake for 35-45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. Heat the heavy cream in a small saucepan until just boiling. Add the dark chocolate to a medium bowl and pour the hot cream over. Mix until the chocolate is melted and smooth. Invert the bundt cake onto a serving plate. Pour the chocolate ganache in the center hole, allowing it to overflow and cover the cake. Dust the cake with cocoa powder and let sit for 30 minutes before slicing. Enjoy!
