1 box chocolate cake mix 1½ cup of water ⅓ cup vegetable oil 3 eggs 4 ounces pudding mix 2 cups milk 2 cups whipped cream 2 cups crushed cookies 2 cups gummy worms Chocolate fudge sauce
Preheat the oven to 350˚F (175˚C). In a large bowl, add the chocolate cake mix, water, vegetable oil, and eggs and whisk until well combined. Add the batter to a 9x13 inch (23x33cm) oven proof baking dish, and bake for 25 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean. Add the pudding mix and milk to a bowl. Whisk until well combined. Fold in the whipped cream and crushed cookies until evenly incorporated. Let the cake rest for 20 minutes. Using the base of a wooden spoon, poke holes in the cake and fill with the gummy worms. Drizzle the cake with chocolate fudge sauce. Use a spatula to spread the whipped cream and cookie mixture over the cake. Transfer to the fridge to chill for 1 hour. Top the cake with remaining gummy worms and crushed cookies. Enjoy!
