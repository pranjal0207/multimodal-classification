American
n/a 1 14-oz can dulce de leche, warmed 1 16-oz can store-bought chocolate frosting ½ cup chopped pecans ½ cup mini chocolate chips Caramel syrup
Using the back of a wooden spoon, poke at least 3 rows of 4 holes in the cooked cake, making 12 holes total. Pour the dulce de leche over the cake and let settle into the holes for about 10 minutes. Some of the dulce de leche will still stay on top, which is okay. If necessary, it can be reheated or mixed with a little milk to be thinned. Spread the chocolate frosting evenly on top of the cake. Sprinkle the chopped pecans and mini chocolate chips on top of the frosting, then drizzle with the caramel. Chill the cake for at least 3 hours or up to overnight. Enjoy!
