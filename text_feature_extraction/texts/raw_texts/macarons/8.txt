1 cup of aquafaba (chickpea liquid) 1 cup powdered sugar 1½ cups almond meal 1 tablespoon dark cocoa powder ½ tablespoon cream of tartar ½ cup sugar ½ cup smooth peanut butter, refrigerated
Pour 1 cup (240 ml) aquafaba into a pot and reduce to ⅓ cup (80 ml) over low heat. Refrigerate aquafaba overnight. Preheat oven to 250°F (120°C). In a bowl, add the powdered sugar, almond meal, and dark cocoa powder, and whisk to combine. Add the chilled aquafaba to another bowl and beat until soft peaks begin to form. Add the cream of tartar and sugar to the whipped aquafaba and beat until soft peaks form. Sift powdered sugar, almond meal, and dark cocoa powder into the whipped aquafaba, and gently fold ingredients together. Transfer the batter to a piping bag and pipe directly onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Let the tray rest at room temperature for 2 hours until the surface does not stick to fingertips. Bake for 30 minutes. Let the macarons cool for 15 minutes. Pipe the peanut butter onto the macarons. Refrigerate macarons for another 2 hours before serving. Enjoy!
