Cozy Chicken And Dumplings Recipe by Tasty
Dinner
Here's what you need: oil, boneless, skinless chicken breast, large onion, carrot, garlic cloves, salt, unsalted butter, all-purpose flour, chicken broth, heavy cream, dried thyme, bay leaf, frozen peas, fresh parsley, all-purpose flour, baking powder, salt, heavy cream

2 tablespoons oil 2 pounds chicken breasts 1 large onion, diced 4 carrots, sliced to ¼ in half rings 3 garlic cloves, minced 1 teaspoon salt 5 tablespoons unsalted butter 6 tablespoons all-purpose flour 6 cups chicken broth ½ cup heavy cream ½ teaspoons dried thyme 2 bay leaves 1 ½ frozen peas 4 tablespoons fresh minced parsley 2 cups all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon baking powder ½ teaspoon salt 1 ⅓ cups heavy cream
In a 6-quart/6-liter dutch oven, add the oil over medium-high heat. Add the chicken breast and cook until brown on both sides. Once chicken pieces are browned, remove and set aside. Add carrot and onion and cook until just tender, about 3 minutes. Add garlic and stir for another minute. Reduce heat to medium-low and add butter and flour, stirring constantly for 3 minutes to avoid lumps. Add chicken and any accumulated juices back to dutch oven and stir to coat in roux/vegetable mix. Add chicken broth, cream, thyme, and bay leaves and bring to a simmer. Once soup is at a simmer, add frozen peas and cover. In a separate bowl, combine flour, baking powder, salt, pepper, and cream. Stir until mixture comes together into single mass of dough. Using a large spoon or ice cream scoop, form dough into small round balls about 1 inch (2 ½ cm) in diameter (this dough mixture should yield 14-16 dumplings). Place dough balls into simmering soup (making sure they don’t touch), add fresh parsley, and cover. Let soup simmer for 15 minutes or until dumplings are cooked (they should pass the toothpick test). Ladle into bowl, giving 1-2 dumplings per serving. Enjoy!
