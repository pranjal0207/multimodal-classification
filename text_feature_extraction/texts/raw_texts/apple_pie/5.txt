American
1½ cups finely-ground graham cracker crumbs ⅓ cup granulated sugar ½ tablespoon cinnamon 7 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 1 cup apple juice 1½ ounces cinnamon whiskey ¾ cup vodka 2 packets unflavored gelatin powder Whipped cream, for serving Cinnamon, for serving
Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). In a large bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, sugar, cinnamon, and melted butter. In a greased 6-cup muffin tin, press the graham cracker mixture firmly into each cup, ensuring it evenly coats the sides and bottom. Bake for 7-10 minutes, or until the butter has been fully absorbed by the graham cracker crumbs. Freeze the crusts for 15 minutes. In a small saucepan, add the apple juice, cinnamon whiskey, and vodka. Add the gelatin and bring to a simmer over medium heat, whisking until the gelatin is dissolved. Remove the pan from the heat. Using a baster, fill cooled graham cracker crusts with the gelatin mixture. Refrigerate for 30 minutes, or until the gelatin is firm. Cut each cup into quarters and garnish with whipped cream and cinnamon. Enjoy!
