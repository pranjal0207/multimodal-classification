Fusion
1 sheet puff pastry Handful pecans, chopped 25 grams melted butter 1 teaspoon brown sugar 1 apple, cut into 8 segments 2 teaspoons cinnamon 1 teaspoon nutmeg 1 teaspoon ginger 1/2 teaspoon allspice
Stir all of the ‘spice mix’ ingredients together. Roll the puff pastry out and cut some rough isosceles triangle shapes from it. Take a thick slice of apple, dip it into the melted butter and place on the end of the pastry. Scatter a teaspoon of brown sugar over the pastry. Pour some roughly chopped pecans on top of that. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of spice mix over all of that. Starting at the apple segment, roll the pastry until everything is wrapped into a neat little package. Bake in the centre of a pre-heated oven for 25-30 minutes - 180°C (350°F) Gas Mark 4. Allow to cool for 3-5 minutes before eating because the contents are hot! Enjoy!
