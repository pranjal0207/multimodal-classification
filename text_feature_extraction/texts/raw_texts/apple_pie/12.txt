American
8 large Granny Smith apples, peeled and thinly sliced 3 tablespoons lemon juice ¼ cup all-purpose flour ⅔ cup granulated sugar 2½ teaspoons ground cinnamon ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg 2 premade pie crusts, thawed if frozen 1 large egg, beaten ¾ cup heavy cream ¾ cup light brown sugar 2 tablespoons honey 3 tablespoons unsalted butter Sea salt, for garnish
Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). In a large bowl, combine the apple slices, lemon juice, flour, sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Toss until the apples are well coated. Lay 1 of the pie crusts in a 9-inch (23-cm) pie dish. Add the apple slices to the bottom of the crust. Place the other pie crust over the apple slices. Trim any extra dough from the edges. Press the rounded edge of spoon facedown around the edge, making shallow indentations to crimp the crusts together. Cut 4 slits in the top of the pie for ventilation, then brush with the beaten egg. Bake the pie for 50-60 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and no grey-ish or undercooked pastry remains. Let cool completely. In a medium saucepan, combine the heavy cream, brown sugar, and honey. Cook over medium heat until the sugar is dissolved, about 2 minutes. Whisk in the butter and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the caramel reaches a thick consistency. Let the caramel sauce cool for 5 minutes, then pour over the pie. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt. Slice and serve. Enjoy!
