3 lb chicken, cubed ¼ medium white onion, diced ¼ cup chopped scallions 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro 3 tablespoons curry powder 4 sprigs fresh thyme 2 tablespoons chopped parsley 2 teaspoons salt ½ teaspoon pepper 2 tablespoons oil ½ medium white onion, diced 2 cloves garlic, minced 2 tablespoons curry powder ¼ cup chopped scallions 1 13.5-ounce can coconut milk Pepper, to taste 1½ cups chicken broth Cilantro, for garnish
In a large mixing bowl, combine the chicken with the onion, scallions, garlic, cilantro, curry powder, thyme, parsley, salt, and pepper.  Mix and let marinate for at least 1 hour in the refrigerator. Heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium heat until shimmering, and add the onion and garlic. Cook for 1-2 minutes, until fragrant. Add the curry powder and stir well, cooking for 3-4 minutes more. Add the scallions and coconut milk, increase the heat to medium-high, and cook for 8-10 minutes, until the coconut milk is boiling and begins to thicken. Add the marinated chicken and stir well. Cook the chicken for 5 minutes, or until starting to brown. Season with pepper. Add the chicken broth to the pot and stir. Bring to a rolling boil and cover the pot. Simmer for 30 minutes, until the sauce thickens into a gravy. Garnish with cilantro. Enjoy!
