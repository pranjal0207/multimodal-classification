American
1 pound chicken wings 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon salt ¼ cup honey ¼ cup dijon mustard ½ teaspoon salt ½ teaspoon pepper
Preheat oven to 400˚F (200˚C). Remove excess moisture from chicken wings with a paper towel. In a large bowl, stir in baking powder and salt until chicken is thoroughly coated. Bake on a baking rack for 1 hour, or until golden brown and crispy, flipping every 20 minutes. For best results, place baking rack on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper or foil to catch drippings. In a skillet, combine honey mustard sauce ingredients on medium heat and stir in chicken wings until fully coated. Serve with your favorite side dish or dipping sauce. Enjoy!
