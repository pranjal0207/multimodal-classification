Here's what you need: chicken wings, baking powder, salt, hot sauce, pepper
American
1 pound chicken wings 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon salt 1 cup hot sauce 1 teaspoon pepper
Preheat oven to 400˚F (200˚C). Remove excess moisture from chicken wings with a paper towel. In a large bowl, stir in baking powder and salt until chicken is thoroughly coated. Bake on a baking rack for 1 hour, or until golden brown and crispy, flipping every 20 minutes. (For best results, place baking rack on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper or foil to catch drippings). In a skillet, combine buffalo sauce ingredients on medium heat. Then stir in chicken wings until fully coated. Serve with your favorite side dish or dipping sauce. Enjoy!
