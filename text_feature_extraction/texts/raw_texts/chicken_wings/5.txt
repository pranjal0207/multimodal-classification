Fusion
1 pound chicken wings 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon salt ⅓ cup low-sodium soy sauce 2 tablespoons honey 2 tablespoons brown sugar 1 tablespoon sesame seeds
Preheat oven to 400˚F/200˚C. Remove excess moisture from chicken wings with a paper towel. In a large bowl, stir in baking powder and salt until chicken is thoroughly coated. Bake on a baking rack for 1 hour, or until golden brown and crispy, flipping every 20 minutes. (For best results, place baking rack on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper or foil to catch drippings). In a skillet, combine soy sauce, honey, and brown sugar on medium heat. Bring to a boil and add in sesame seeds. Once sauce is thickened, stir in chicken wings until fully coated. Serve with your favorite side dish or dipping sauce. Enjoy!
