In a bowl, toss ¼ cup of cornstarch and the chicken wings together until fully coated. Transfer the wings to a wire rack and let rest and dry out for 20 minutes, ideally in the fridge if you have space. In a medium bowl, whisk together the remaining ½ cup of cornstarch, the flour, paprika, garlic powder, cayenne, baking powder, salt, and pepper. Gradually whisk in the water, breaking up any lumps and mixing until smooth. The batter should be slightly runny. Heat the oil in a large pot until it reaches 350°F (180°C). Coat chicken wings in the batter, shaking off any excess. Add the wings to the oil in batches, cooking for 8-10 minutes until golden brown. Transfer the chicken wings wot a wire rack set over a paper towel-lined baking sheet. Transfer the chicken to a clean bowl and drizzle with with the buffalo sauce, tossing to coat.
