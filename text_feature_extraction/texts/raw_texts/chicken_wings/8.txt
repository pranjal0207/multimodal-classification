American
1½ pounds chicken wings 2 teaspoons baking powder ¼ teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon butter 1 tablespoon garlic, minced 2 tablespoons dried Italian herb blend 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped
Preheat oven to 250˚F (130˚C). Place wings in a large bowl and pat dry. Add the baking powder and salt to the wings. Stir to coat. Spray a baking rack with nonstick cooking spray and place on top of a foiled sheet pan. Distribute wings evenly on top, making sure none of them touch and they are all face-up. Bake for 35 minutes, then increase the temperature to 425˚F (220˚C) and bake for an additional 45 minutes, or until wings are crisp and golden. (Do not remove the wings from the oven when increasing temperature.) For sauce, in a hot pan, melt butter. Add garlic and stir. Cook for 30 seconds, being careful not to burn the garlic. Stir in Italian herb blend and salt. Cook for an additional 20 seconds. Add in fresh parsley and wings. Stir to coat. Enjoy!
