Cajun BBQ Baked Wings Recipe by Tasty
Appetizers
Here's what you need: chicken wings, baking powder, salt, BBQ sauce, cajun seasoning
BBQ
1½ pounds chicken wings 2 teaspoons baking powder ¼ teaspoon salt ¾ cup BBQ sauce 1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning/spice mix
Preheat oven to 250˚F (130˚C). Place wings in a large bowl and pat dry. Add the baking powder and salt to the wings. Stir to coat. Spray a baking rack with nonstick cooking spray and place on top of a foiled sheet pan. Distribute wings evenly on top, making sure none of them touch and they are all face-up. Bake for 35 minutes, then increase the temperature to 425˚F (220˚C) and bake for an additional 45 minutes, or until wings are crisp and golden. (Do not remove the wings from the oven when increasing temperature.) For sauce, combine BBQ sauce and Cajun seasoning in a hot pan. Bring to a boil and add wings. Stir to coat the wings. Enjoy!
