American
½ cup flour ½ teaspoon chili powder ½ teaspoon garlic powder ½ teaspoon pepper ½ teaspoon salt 1 pound chicken wings 1 mango 3 habanero peppers, optional seeded or unseeded 2 garlic cloves ½ teaspoon paprika ¼ cup apple cider vinegar 2 tablespoons lime juice ¼ cup honey
Preheat oven to 425ºF (220ºC). In a small mixing bowl, combine flour, chili powder, garlic powder, pepper, and salt. Pat the chicken wings dry using a paper towel. Batter them in the flour mixture and place chicken wings on a wired baking sheet. Bake at 425ºF (220ºC) for 45 minutes, flipping halfway for even cooking. In a food processor or blender, mix together the mango, habanero peppers, garlic, paprika, apple cider vinegar, and lime juice. Blend until fully combined. The mixture should be a bright orange vibrant color. In a saucepan, combine honey with your mango habanero mixture at medium heat. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking and simmer for 5-10 minutes or until your sauce reaches a prefered consistency. Fully coat your cooked wings in the sauce then place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake at 450ºF (230ºC) for 8-10 minutes or until sauce has slightly caramelized. Enjoy!
