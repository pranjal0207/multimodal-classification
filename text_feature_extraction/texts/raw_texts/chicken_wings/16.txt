Fusion
1½ pounds chicken wings 2 teaspoons baking powder ¼ teaspoon salt ½ cup soy sauce 2 tablespoons brown sugar 2 tablespoons honey 1 tablespoon sesame seeds
Preheat oven to 250˚F (130˚C). Place wings in a large bowl and pat dry. Add the baking powder and salt to the wings. Stir to coat. Spray a baking rack with nonstick cooking spray and place on top of a foiled sheet pan. Distribute wings evenly on top, making sure none of them touch and they are all face-up. Bake for 35 minutes, then increase the temperature to 425˚F (220˚C) and bake for an additional 45 minutes, or until wings are crisp and golden. (Do not remove the wings from the oven when increasing temperature.) For sauce, in a hot pan, bring soy sauce to a boil. Stir in brown sugar and honey. Add in sesame seeds and stir until slightly thickened and bubbling. Add wings and stir to coat. Enjoy!
