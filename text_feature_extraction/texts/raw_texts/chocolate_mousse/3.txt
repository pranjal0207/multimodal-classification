Cookies And Cream Mousse  Recipe by Tasty
Desserts
Here's what you need: chocolate sandwich cookie, heavy cream, powdered sugar

8 chocolate sandwich cookies, plus more for topping 1½ cups heavy cream ½ cup powdered sugar
Separate the cream from the chocolate sandwich cookies. Place the cookies in a plastic bag and the cream in a small bowl. Using a rolling pin, crush the cookies until they are finely ground. Microwave the cream from the chocolate sandwich cookies for 2 minutes. In a chilled medium bowl, beat the heavy cream using a hand mixer until thick and frothy. Add the cream from the cookies and the powdered sugar. Beat until stiff peaks form. Fold in the chocolate sandwich cookie crumbs, saving some as topping for later. Spoon into a piping bag or plastic bag with a piping tip. Pipe into serving bowls or glasses. Top with remaining chocolate sandwich cookie crumbs and half of a chocolate sandwich cookie, if desired. Serve immediately or refrigerate until ready to serve. Enjoy!
