Ingridients:
egg yolks1 cup white sugar, divided1 pound mascarpone cheese6 egg whites, stiffly beaten1/4 cup heavy cream3 tablespoons kirschwasser1 1/4 cups strong brewed coffee, cold25 ladyfingers1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder

Method:
In a medium bowl beat together the egg yolks and 1/3 cup of sugar. Using a wooden spoon stir in mascarpone cheese, beaten egg whites, cream and kirschwasser; stir until smooth. Set aside.
Dissolve remaining 2/3 cup sugar in coffee. Quickly, to avoid complete saturation, dip ends of ladyfingers in coffee mixture. Place ladyfingers in a single layer in a 9 x 13 inch glass baking dish. Spread a layer of cheese mixture over the ladyfingers; repeat layers, ending with cheese mixture.
Cover and refrigerate for several hours. Sprinkle with cocoa just before serving.
