Ingridients:
300 g (150g per person) fresh sashimi-grade tuna steak or salmon fillets

To serve

wasabi, to serve

Japanese soy sauce (or gluten-free alternative), to serve

pickled ginger, to serve

1 white radish, spiralised or shredded



Method:

Just before you are ready to eat, slice the fillet, against the grain into little rectangles about 2cm thick. The technique is to hold the fish firmly with one hand, position the knife beside your fingers to make an against-the-grain slice and pull the knife through from base to tip in a single stroke. Serve with the accompaniments.
